# Discord-OTP-Forcer
This is a Selenium and Python based Discord TOTP forcer. It attempts to brute force randomly generated 6 or 8 digit codes with a random delay between each attempt.

*Look at him go!*

Instructions on how to setup and use this program can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Derpitron/Discord-OTP-Forcer/wiki/How-to-setup-and-use)

# Features
- Brute forces 6 digit TOTP codes (1 million possible codes)
- Brute force 6 digit alphanumerical codes without lowercases (2 billion possible codes)
- Brute forces 8 digit Backup codes (2.82 trillion possible codes)
- Brute force 8 digit alphabetical only codes (2 billion possible codes)
- Ratelimit avoidance (Cooldown between every code attempt)
- Robust easy to read log formatting
- Can brute force Password Reset page's TOTP codes.
- Waits for you to complete the hCaptcha
- Automatically closes when the hCaptcha ticket or browser session expires, and prints useful info (e.g No. of attempted codes, time taken, no. of ratelimits)
- Blocks analytics URLs such as Cloudflare logging, Discord Science, and Sentry.io
- User friendly

# Dependencies
- Google Chrome
- Python >= 3.10

# Why did I make this?
In December 2021, I lost access to my passwords and OTP list due to a file syncing issue. I was able to recover most of the credentials, except for my Discord Alt. When I contacted Discord Support, they informed me that due to their security policy, they could not disable 2FA for that account, which while it is understandable, is unfortunate. As a proof-of-concept program, I hacked together this crude script which simply brute forces randomly generated 6 digit numbers to the Discord login's TOTP field.

# Known Issues
- Depends on HTML element class names in order to detect failure/success
- Script relies on the Chrome WebDriver, thus Google Chrome will have to be installed.
- Requires **Python Version >= 3.10** to work.
